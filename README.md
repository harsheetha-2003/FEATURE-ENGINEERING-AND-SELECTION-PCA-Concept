# FEATURE-ENGINEERING-AND-SELECTION-PCA-Concept

where i have analysed the heart disease code by selecting features with the help of coorelation matrics.
coorelation matrics helped me to identify 3 feature depending on which heart disease is closely related.
PCA concept is used to check how well the data can be represented into lower dimention and tells the how well the data is seperated
